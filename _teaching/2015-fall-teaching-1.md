In this 3-credit seminar-style class which was piloted as a 496/896 before being assigned the permanent course number of 454/854, students are guided through an overview of human-robot interaction as a field, explore a topic of their choosing both individually and as a class, and have guest lectures from practitioners. The goal of this course is for students to not only gain an understanding of the current state of HRI as a field, but also to learn research methods to aid them in their future careers. Students are expected to present papers in both 30 minute and 10 minute formats, write critiques for each class meeting, complete a literature review on a topic of their choosing, and either prepare a short NSF-style proposal based on a problem identified and refined through their literature review or demonstrate skill in conducting a small user study or data analysis.
