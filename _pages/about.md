I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I am a co-Director of the [NIMBUS Lab](https://nimbus.unl.edu/), where we study unmanned systems (with a focus on aerial robotics). I was awarded an NSF Early Faculty Career Award (CAREER) to continue studying foundational interactions between novice users and small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. I completed my Ph.D. at Texas A&M University, studying field robotics and human-robot interaction through the Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue.

My research is focused at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Human-Robot Interaction, and Unmanned Systems. My long-term research goal is to advance the state-of-the-art in human-drone interaction so that small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (sUAVs) can comfortably and safely interact in proximity to a variety of people and communicate with them in a natural and efficient way across varying contexts (see [Smithsonian Magazine](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-people-comfortable-with-small-drones-180951433/), June 2014). I approach interactions with small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles through an exploration of behavior-based robotics and cognitive science principles. Additionally, I have been involved in extensive fieldwork through environmental applications of drones with NIMBUS, as well as urban search and rescue at the Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue including 6 exercises and a deployment in 2014 to the SR-530 mudslides in Oso, Washington.
