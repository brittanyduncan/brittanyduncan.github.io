Outreach course to 28 seniors from the Lincoln community proposed in and funded by my NSF CAREER award.

This course will focus on ways in which you encounter artificial intelligence in your everyday life and how you might influence these interactions. Even for those who do not own smart devices, you may be surprised about the ways that companies use artificial intelligence to engage with consumers. A significant portion of this class will be discussion-based to allow for engagement with the topic area and to steer the focus of the course based on the interests of the students.
