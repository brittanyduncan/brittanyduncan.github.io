This talk will discuss the role of human-robot interaction in field-based robot deployments and be focused on three individual research areas: integration of robots into high performing teams, improved teleoperation, and necessary autonomy for improved team performance. Specific research questions that will be addressed include: 1) What role does the use of aerial vehicles play in shared decision making with high performing and potentially distributed teams?  2) How can interfaces and interactions amplify the current reach of the end users? and 3) What adaptations are necessary within the autonomy to augment user perceptions in field-based environments? This discussion will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in agriculture and robotics communities, as well as those in the fields of human factors, artificial intelligence, and the social sciences.
